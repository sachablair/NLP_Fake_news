# NLP_Fake_news
Our work aims to classify fake news. Our dataset contains more than 20 000 news and among them, half is real news and the other half is fake news. We have processed the texts of the comments using three different embedding vectorizers (TF-IDF, Word2Vec and BERT). For the classification of fake news, in the first time, we have used four classic models (logistic regression, SVM, RF and naive Bayes) using TF-IDF embedding. In the second part, we have used LSTM and BiLSTM models using Word2Vec embedding. And then, we have used the BERT transformer in the last section.
